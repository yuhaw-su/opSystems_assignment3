C compiled with gcc-linked clang-800.0.38 (Mac)
To compile, navigate to the inner directories within the terminal and run:

    gcc <scheduling-method>.c -o <scheduling-method>

For example, to compile FCFS, navigate to the FCFS directory (cd FCFS), then:

    gcc FCFS.c -o FCFS

To run the generated binary, then run:

    ./<scheduling-method> <input-file>

For example, to run the FCFS binary with an input file input1 (also in the FCFS directory), enter:

    ./FCFS input1
